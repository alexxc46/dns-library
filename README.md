# DNS Library

This is a custom and very basic Laravel package for querying DNS records of a domain. The main purpose of the application is to show how a library added and registered inside a Laravel application

## Installation

PHP and composer should be installed on your local machine
Clone the repository with : git clone https://github.com/alexxc46/dns-library.git

Once the server has started you can paste the suggested url into your browser (http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in most cases)
You can see the test output on the main page

## Testing
